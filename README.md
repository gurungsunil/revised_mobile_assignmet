# revised_mobile_assignment

I have follow up the all the instruction mention in the assignment. As for the design I have tried to
make it as similar as in the given design shot. I have used same color code used in design
but flutter engine render color slightly differently even though it has same color code.

As mention in the instruction the email validation is mandatory so I have implement it in both Login 
and signup view. And for next instruction 'Login by Gmail should be allowed' I have sort of confusion
what is actually referring to so I have implement Google Sign in in Login view. 

If you find any of the task had been missing feel free to contact me. Thank you for this opportunity.

Regards,
Sunil Gurung
